# Low-Level

This repository was originally created as a space to practice C by recreating standard library functions and exploring core concepts. My primary goal has been to deepen my understanding of C through hands-on projects and experiments with pointers, memory management, and low-level operations.

Through my journey to truly grasp the nuances of C, I’ve found that understanding the underlying system on which C operates, as well as the reasons behind certain behaviors, has been the most effective approach for me.

This has led me to dive deeper into Operating Systems. I’ve been learning more through various books and specific YouTube channels, and I plan to share these resources here for anyone who might like to take a similar approach to learning C.
